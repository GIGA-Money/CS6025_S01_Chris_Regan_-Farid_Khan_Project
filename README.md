This research is to understand the application of Sysplm as a system programming language for IoT devices. We are interested in understanding the theoretical aspect of OS in smart devices and the broad application of sysplm as a standard for micro-controllers. Also to make the process of software development  more efficient, secure and user friendly.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of IoT (Internet of Things)/ smart devices can be traced to the Mark Wesier article published in Scientific Journal in 1991. It was called “ The Computer for the 21st century” [1]. The paper originated the concept of ubiquitous computing, which is to have computing power available regardless of location or time period. Smart devices are descended of this concept.
